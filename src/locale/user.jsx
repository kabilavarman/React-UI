   * Gets the programmatic name of the entire locale, with the language,
   *   country and variant separated by underbars. The Language is always lower case,
   *   and country is always upper case. If the language is missing,
   *   the string will begin with an underscore character.
   *   If both the language and country fields are missing,
   *   this function will return the empty string,
   *   even if the variant field is filled in (you cannot have a locale with just a variant--
   *   the variant must accompany a valid language or country code). Examples: "en"
